# ARCHIVE — decision log and history

Sections 1–13 are reserved for project history (release notes, incident notes, migration notes). Section 14 is the **decision log** every session appends to. Newest entry at the bottom. Never edit a past entry; append a correction. Public repository: entries describe behaviour and structure only — never a real deployment's hosts, users, paths or names.

### 2026-09-27 — Project inception and locked decisions D-001…D-022 (no PR; planning)
**Decision:** Build a generic, security-first MCP server for host-level operations over SSH — read, write, destructive and root — in Go (latest stable, 1.27 at inception), as three binaries: `shell-mcp` (MCP server, distroless container), `shell-mcp-gate` (SSH forced command on each target, enforcing a root-owned gate policy as an unprivileged, pinned-UID service account) and `shell-mcp-privd` (socket-activated privileged helper for declared root actions). No shell, no interpreters, no free-form argv: native operations for files, system state and certificates; fixed hardened argv for systemd, journal and git; argv templates with typed placeholders for anything else. The gate applies `no_new_privs` and a policy-derived Landlock sandbox before reading the request. No sudo or setuid anywhere: unit control uses a generated polkit rule; every other root action is forwarded to the helper, which authenticates the gate by `SO_PEERCRED`, validates against its own root-owned privileged policy (with a permanent never list and an acknowledge list for power/kernel/storage/firewall/persistence), runs one instance per request under a generated systemd sandbox pinned to the policy hash, and backs up what it changes. Destructive operations and privileged changes require human approval collected through MCP elicitation and HMAC-bound to the operation. Capability is enabled explicitly per server profile and per host policy. Pinned SSH host keys, Ed25519 client keys, per-key policies. MCP 2026-07-28 via the official Go SDK. Apache-2.0, public from the first commit, latest-everything enforced in CI. Sessions use Opus 5.5 (High for security-critical work).
**Why:** Derived from requirements (plan §1.1). Authorization belongs on the host, out of reach of the credential-holding server; SSH provides authenticated, auditable, per-key-restricted transport without a new daemon; binaries carry escape hatches, so native operations and exact templates replace them; the kernel backs our userspace confinement. Root is sometimes the job, but sudo would force the gate out of its sandbox and matches argv text; a separate root process with its own typed policy and systemd sandbox gives the same capability with a much smaller blast radius. A model-supplied confirmation flag is not human consent. Go makes gate and helper dependency-free static binaries, compatible with the latest-everything rule on arbitrary hosts.
**Alternatives rejected:** A long-running agent per host (new listener and credential store). Docker socket / privileged container / `nsenter` (root-equivalent). Ansible/Salt as executor (root, arbitrary modules). Cockpit bridge or a generic remote shell (no host-side policy). A local-socket transport for the same-host case (second transport to audit). Python (compatibility window on hosts). Sudo, with enumerated or generated rules (incompatible with the gate sandbox; text-matched; unconfined root). `confirm` arguments as approval (model-controlled). OAuth in v1 (shell access should not be internet-exposed). Fable 5.1 for sessions (its additional cybersecurity safeguards conflict with writing sandbox-escape and privilege-boundary tests; Opus 5.5 at High covers the need).
**Deferred / follow-ups:** Package managers other than apt. Seccomp for gate children. OAuth resource-server mode — parked. Multi-principal servers. Non-Linux targets. Client support for elicitation is verified in S2; D-006 fails closed until it is present.
**Versions:** Go 1.27 (latest stable at inception); MCP Go SDK v1.7.x line (first with 2026-07-28); go-landlock newest; all other versions resolved in S0.
